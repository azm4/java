# About 
Developed at **Sun Microsystems** which was purchased by **Oracle** in 2010. **Java** is general purpose and mostly used for developing software running on *mobile, desktop, and servers*.
It is also machine independent. It is based on the **C Programming Language**. 
# Java Language Specification
To write usable code in **Java** we need to follow it's own *Syntax* and *Semantics*. 
# Application Programming Interface
It is also known as a ***library***. Contains predefined java codes. Similar to **Library Functions in C**.
# Java Editions
Different **Java** editions are used for developing different types of application. 
- **Java Standart Edition (SE)**: Used for desktop application.
- **Java Enterprise Edition (EE)**: Used for server-side application.
- **Java Micro Edition (ME)**: Used for mobile application.
# Java Development Kit (JDK)
It is a set of programs which enable us to develop programs in **Java**.
It contains **Java Runtime Environment(JRE)** it is used to run our programs.
> JRE & JDK both contain Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JVM executes **Java** program on different machines. For that reason, Java is machine independent.
# Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
It is a program that allows us to *write, compile, debug, build, run* Java code.

### Classes & Objects
> Technically speaking, A **Class** is a blueprint to create an **Object** and an **Object** is an instance of a **Class**.
### Class Structure
```java
class class_name { // class name must be similar to the filename if public
    // code block
}
```
**class** is a keyword.
### Method 
Group of instruction to do a specific task. Methods are similar to functions that we use in **C**.
### Method Structure
```java
return_type method_name (parameters) {
    // code block
}
```
> Note: Every Method is written inside a **Class**.
### Calling A Method
```java
method_name ( input parameters );
```
> Note: The **main()** method is automatically called when we run our **Java** program.
> - Similar to the **main()** function in **C**.
> - Starting of the program execution.
> - All methods are executed inside **main()** method.
### Access Modifiers
Specifies how to access Classes & Methods. They are all keywords.

> - Private
> - Protected
